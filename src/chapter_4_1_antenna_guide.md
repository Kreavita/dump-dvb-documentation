# Antenna guide

## Choosing an antenna

There are multiple antennas which can be bought of the self, though not as good an easy solution to get started.

A better option is to build your own antenna matched to the frequency you're trying to receive.
We have a guide for building a dipole antenna, which can also be disgused as a weather station [here](./chapter_4_1_1_dipole_antenna.md).
